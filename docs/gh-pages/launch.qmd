# Launching a Project

Sequence data has arrived. What next?

## Checklist

- [ ] WGS delivered?
- [ ] HiC delivered?
- [ ] RNAseq delivered?
- [ ] Isoseq delivered?
- [ ] Link raw data
- [ ] Create private project repo from assembly template

## How to:

### Structure data

1. Make a translation table in data/raw-data linking the NGI delivery files to the data we're going to use. Need a way to mark bad data.

### Assemble sequence data

### Annotate assemblies

### Perform downstream analyses

### Integrate new analyses

2. Need a way to integrate custom scripts into template while it's not
integrated into the workflow. 

### Troubleshoot

3. Need a protocol for troubleshooting. Who to ask
