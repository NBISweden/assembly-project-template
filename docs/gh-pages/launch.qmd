# Analysis

Sequence data has arrived. What next?

## Checklist

- [ ] WGS delivered?
- [ ] HiC delivered?
- [ ] RNAseq delivered?
- [ ] Isoseq delivered?
- [ ] Link raw data
- [ ] Create private project repo from assembly template

## How to:

### Structure data

All data should be structured in the `data/` folder as follows to make data findable.

```{.default}
data/
  | - deliveries
  | - raw-data
  | - intermediates
  \ - finalized
```

- `data/deliveries` contains read-only folders of deliveries from the sequencing centers.
- `data/raw-data` contains subfolders that indicate the sequence data type, e.g. `PacBio-Revio-WGS` and within those folders
  are symlinks to data in subfolders of `data/deliveries`. Additional data downloaded from other locations should
  also be in subfolders and include a shell script that can redownload the file from the original location. e.g.,

  ```{.bash}
  #! /usr/bin/env bash
  curl -O ftp://path/to/public/archive/file.ext
  ```

- `data/intermediates` contains the results from tools lauched in the analyses folders using the same label as the launching folder.
  e.g., `analyses/01_assembly-workflow_initial-run_rackham` puts results in `data/intermediates/01_assembly-workflow_initial-run_rackham`.
- `data/finalized` contains symlinks to folders in `data/intermediates` which are stage end-points, e.g. the raw-reads have been processed
  in various ways, and after looking at QC controls, one folder is selected to be used for assembly. This is symlinked in finalized.

1. Make a translation table in data/raw-data linking the NGI delivery files to the data we're going to use. Need a way to mark bad data.

### Assemble sequence data

### Annotate assemblies

### Perform downstream analyses

### Integrate new analyses

2. Need a protocol to integrate custom scripts into template while it's not
integrated into the workflow. 

- Put custom code in `code/scripts`, `code/snakemake`, `code/nextflow`, and launch scripts under `code/launch_templates`.
- Make sure the code uses containers or conda environments to package the software environment.
- Make an issue on the template to integrate the code into the template so that it's shareable until it's integrated into
a workflow.
- Make an issue on the relevant workflow to integrate the tools.

### Troubleshoot

3. Need a protocol for troubleshooting. Who to ask
