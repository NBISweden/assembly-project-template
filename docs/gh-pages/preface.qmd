# Onboarding {.unnumbered}

Here you can find instructions on how to run assembly projects
for the VR-EBP, ERGA, and BGE projects.

## Getting started

A Github account is needed. A new member needs to added to the NBISweden Github organisation 
(Responsible: FIXME), and then to the ERGA assemblies team (Responsible: Martin P.) to access 
this webpage and template.

New members also need to be added to the NAISS compute and storage allocations in SUPR 
(Responsible: Henrik).

Life-cyle:
