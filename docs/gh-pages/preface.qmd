# Onboarding {.unnumbered}

Here you can find instructions on how to run assembly projects
for the VR-EBP, ERGA, and BGE projects.

## Getting started

A Github account is needed. A new member needs to added to the NBISweden Github organisation 
(ask on #technical-operations), and then to the ERGA assemblies team (Responsible: Martin P.).

New members also need to be added to the NAISS compute and storage allocations in SUPR 
(Responsible: Henrik / Mahesh).

Life-cyle:
