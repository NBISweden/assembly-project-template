# Monitoring

Assembly, annotation, and pop gen analyses are in progress.

- Who is responsible?
- What happens when someone else is made responsible?
- How do we notify project progress?
- What happens when the data is insufficient?
- What happens when the data is too contaminated?

- How to monitor stages?
    - Depends on whether Trello or Github is used as progress tracker.
    - Trello:
        - Card has current assignee.
        - Progress tracked with checklist.
    - Github:
        - Automated tracking with issues?
        - Responsibility auto assigned?

- Keep report up to date.
