# Quick Start

- Make a private Project repository from this template repository on Github.
    1. Select `New Repository` on Github from the `+` symbol in the top right corner.
    1. Select `NBISweden/assembly_project_template` in `Repository template`.
    1. Update `owner` to `NBISweden`.
    1. Provide a repository name following `<project>-<species>-<year>-<short_description>` where
        - `<project>`: 
            - `VREBP`: For VR-EBP projects
            - `ERGA`: For ERGA projects 
            - `BGE`: For BGE projects
            - `SMS`: For NBIS short term projects
        - `<species>`: Species name
        - `<year>`: Year project started
        - `<short_description>`: Short project description.
    1. Ensure repository is private, then click Create repository.
- Clone it into the NAISS Storage project.
    ```bash
    cd /proj/snic2021-6-194
    git clone git@github.com:NBISweden/<repo>.git 
    ```
- Update README in the repository with project details.
- Copy NGI deliveries to data folder.
- Link relevant raw data in `data/raw-data`.
- Update `assembly_parameters.yml` to point to files in `data/raw-data`.
- Run analyses, activating any necessary compute environments. 

The template provides an organised folder structure, and skeleton files to quickly
start analyzing.

Analyses are primarily run on Uppmax. Github is used as the primary repository, and
analysis files should be tracked and pushed regularly.
