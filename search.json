Additional data downloaded from other locations should also be in subfolders and include a shell script that can redownload the file from the original location. e.g.,\n#! /usr/bin/env bash\ncurl -O ftp://path/to/public/archive/file.ext\ndata/outputs contains the results from tools lauched in the analyses folders using the same label as the launching folder. e.g., analyses/01_assembly-workflow_initial-run_rackham puts results in data/outputs/01_assembly-workflow_initial-run_rackham.\ndata/frozen contains symlinks to folders in data/outputs which are stage end-points, e.g. the raw-reads have been processed in various ways, and after looking at QC controls, one folder is selected to be used for assembly. This is symlinked in frozen.\n\n\nMake a translation table in data/raw-data linking the NGI delivery files to the data we’re going to use. Need a way to mark bad data.\n\n\n\nAssemble sequence data\n\n\nAnnotate assemblies\n\n\nPerform downstream analyses\n\n\nIntegrate new analyses\n\nNeed a protocol to integrate custom scripts into template while it’s not integrated into the workflow.\n\n\nPut custom code in code/scripts, code/snakemake, code/nextflow, and launch scripts under code/launch_templates.\nMake sure the code uses containers or conda environments to package the software environment.\nMake an issue on the template to integrate the code into the template so that it’s shareable until it’s integrated into a workflow.\nMake an issue on the relevant workflow to integrate the tools.\n\n\n\nTroubleshoot\n\nNeed a protocol for troubleshooting.
